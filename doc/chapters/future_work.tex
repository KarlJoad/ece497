\chapter{Future Work}\label{chap:Future_Work}
In this chapter, we present opportunities that we feel can be leveraged due to the initial work we did during this research project.
We have chosen to break these opportunities up into several categories, each presented in a section below.

\section{Additional Research}\label{sec:Additional_Research}
Chipyard is a large and very complicated piece of software.
Simply getting over the initial hurdle of getting Chipyard to work and getting the generated \Gls{fpga} image written out comprised a majority of our work.
If we had more time to investigate Chipyard and become more familiar with its inner workings, we would like to further explore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating custom heterogenous CPU designs, elaborating them, and writing them out to an \Gls{fpga}.
\item Booting a minimal Linux kernel on the generated \gls{softcore}.
\end{itemize}
