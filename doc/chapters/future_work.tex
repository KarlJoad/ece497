\chapter{Future Work}\label{chap:Future_Work}
In this chapter, we present opportunities that we feel can be leveraged due to the initial work we did during this research project.
We have chosen to break these opportunities up into several categories, each presented in a section below.

\section{Additional Research}\label{sec:Additional_Research}
Chipyard is a large and very complicated piece of software.
Simply getting over the initial hurdle of getting Chipyard to work and getting the generated \Gls{fpga} image written out comprised a majority of our work.
If we had more time to investigate Chipyard and become more familiar with its inner workings, we would like to further explore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating custom heterogenous CPU designs, elaborating them, and writing them out to an \Gls{fpga}.
\item Booting a minimal Linux kernel on the generated \gls{softcore}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Academic Applications}\label{sec:Academic_Applications}
\Gls{riscv} offers a lot to the academic world because it is a open-source CPU design.
This offers the chance to investigate the inner workings of the CPU and its implementation significantly more than many other architectures.
In fact, because \Gls{riscv} has been created by the \UCB{}, there are already academic materials available for use.

In the sections below, we discuss several courses offered at \IIT{} that, we believe, would be perfect candidates for a revamp using \Gls{riscv} and Chipyard.

\subsection{\href{http://bulletin.iit.edu/search/?P=ECE 242}{ECE 242 --- Digital Computers and Computing}}\label{sec:ECE_242}
ECE~242 is intended to be an introductory course to some of the lowerest levels of digital computing.
Namely, this involves in-depth discussion around both \Gls{cisc} and \Gls{risc} architectures, their differences, and how to write \gls{assembly}.

Currently, the \Gls{risc} architecture taught is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture}{MIPS}.
We feel that this is not going to help students in their future work, so we suggest teaching \Gls{riscv} instead.
The base instruction set is not much more complicated, with just forty-seven~(47) instructions for the user-level 32-bit integer instruction set~\cite[pp.~9--26]{riscvISASpec}.
Because the \Gls{riscv} \Gls{isa} is significantly more modern, many of the concepts learned here will still translate to other \Gls{risc} \Glspl{isa}.

By virtue of being more modern, students will gain an appreciation and knowledge of an architecture that they are far more likely to encounter in their career.
This is because \Gls{riscv} supports mixing and matching extensions, so the processors can actually be designed for anything from an embedded microcomputer to high performance computing.
