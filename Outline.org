* Goals
  * Working system
    - Smaller issues still being present in the system are OK
    - Should (for the most part) work correct
  * Is this a feasible thing in the first few weeks?
  * Based off of:
    - [[https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6][GitHub Repository]]
    - [[https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard][Berkeley]]
  * Work will be done from home exclusively

* Presentation Slides
  * 3-5 slides per person per week
  * Keep them up-to-date
  * What we have done
  * What we still need to do
  * Mention if we couldn't get something done due to conflicts

* Progress Report
  * 3-6 pages
  * What we have already done
  * What we expect to be able to finish in the last 4-5 weeks
  * What will be required in the final report will be described at this time

* Final Report
  * 6-10 pages
  * Overview of what we did (Background)
  * What we have done
  * Hint on what other people could be doing/following up with on this project
  * Pretend that another group of peopple are picking this project up after you
    - Give the other people an idea of what we did
  * This can be thought of a tutorial
  * Mention design decisions
    - What libraries we chose
    - Mention library "gotchas"

* Week 01
  * Get software side figured out
  * Clone github software
  * Build the software (Figure out the toolchains)
  * Need to figure out technical platform aspects
  * Read tutorial slides and know what's going on inside each platform
    - Split the job a little bit
    - What kinds of modules are available in ChipYard?
      + Accelerators
      + Processors
      + Memory
  * Ways to simulate the system?
    - Software-only?
    - Put on FPGA?
