\section{About}\label{sec:About}
\paragraph{}The Chipyard Framework contains initial support for FPGA development and simulation of SoC designs. At the moment this support is very limited, and is in active development. As of \today, the best support for FPGA Development for the Arty 35T FPGA comes from a branch of Chipyard called "arty-spi-flash". This branch fixes the UART implementation, and enables the SPI Flash storage on the Arty FPGA to allow users to store programs on the FPGA
